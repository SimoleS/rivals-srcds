## Counter-Strike: Source Dedicated Server - Casual Mod by Rivals.cz

The full configuration of our **Rivals.cz Public CS:S server** which I was mainaining. It's powered by SourceMod and runs bunch of a public and private plugins. As our community server is no longer running, feel free to reuse it's contents for any purpose.

## How to use:
- You need to update configs under **addons/sourcemod/configs/** + **cfg/**, 
- Compile plugins inside **addons/sourcemod/scripting/** 
- Upload custom maps, round end sounds and update sourcemod/metamod. 
- Done - run it on SRCDS server.
