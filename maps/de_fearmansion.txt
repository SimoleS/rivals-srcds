Type: Bomb/Diffuse
Sound: Dr.Boo, Doom 3 

Description: The Boo's in the Haunted Hang Castle have organised a big contest for halloween this year! They made the left wing of their mansion extra haunted and creepy and the contestors must stay the entire night in the house. The one who keeps his pants dry till the morning wins. However, the crazy terrorists decided that this would be the time to blow some shit up.
