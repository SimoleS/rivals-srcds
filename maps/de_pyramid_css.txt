Welcome to de_pyramid_css. Have fun playing.


CTs: Prevent the terrorist scum bags from bombing the ancient Cross of Destiny (site A), and the boxes containing valuable Egyptian artifacts (site B).


Ts: You have two targets here, and bombing either of the two will result in success! Expect heavy resistance from those law abiding CT scum.

GL & HF!
